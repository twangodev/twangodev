# Privacy Policy

## What We Collect
Only anonymous pageviews via our no-cookie analytics—no names, emails, or snack preferences.

## Why
To see which projects make you go “wow.” No ads, no profiling.

## Cookies
Zero. This site is strictly cookie-free.

## Sharing
We don’t sell or trade data—ever. Only a court order could make us do that, but who cares about this site anyway?

## Changes
I’ll tweak this if needed.

*Enjoy your cookie-free browsing! The fact that you have read this far is impressive, and I hope you find the site useful. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.*
