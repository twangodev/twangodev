## Overview

ToolFoam is a Flutter-based application that simplifies the process of creating custom foam inserts for tool organization. It generates precise cutting paths that can be exported to CNC machines or laser cutters, making professional-quality tool storage accessible to everyone.

## Features

- **Intuitive Design Interface**: User-friendly tools for laying out tool positions
- **Path Generation**: Automatically generates optimal cutting paths for foam inserts
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Supports DXF and STEP file formats for compatibility with various cutting machines
- **Precision Control**: Fine-tune dimensions and tolerances for perfect tool fit
- **Material Optimization**: Efficient nesting algorithms to minimize foam waste

## Use Cases

- **Workshop Organization**: Create custom foam inserts for toolboxes and drawers
- **Equipment Cases**: Design protective foam inserts for delicate instruments
- **Hobby Projects**: Organize collections with professional-looking foam storage
- **Industrial Applications**: Standardize tool storage across multiple workstations

## Technical Stack

Built with Flutter and Dart for cross-platform compatibility, ToolFoam runs on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers. The application uses advanced path generation algorithms to create efficient cutting patterns while maintaining structural integrity of the foam.

## Export Capabilities

- **DXF Files**: Compatible with most CNC routers and laser cutters
- **STEP Files**: For 3D modeling and advanced CAD applications
- **SVG Export**: For manual cutting templates or vinyl cutters
